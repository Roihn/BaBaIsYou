## Introduction
Baba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules you have to follow are present as physical objects in the game world. 
By manipulating the rules, you can change how the game works, repurpose things you find in the levels and cause surprising interactions!

## How to Play
In each level, you can see several objects and words on the game map. 
You can use the arrow keys to control the movement of certain objects, find the associated word to the object that you can control, and you will see it makes a `BABA IS YOU` pattern.
